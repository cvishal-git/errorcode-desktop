Check if there is ny error in Servo drives.\n4. Check the error on the drive and set it by referring to the servo manual.\n5. Reset the alarm after appropriate remedies.\nNotes:\nWhen any of the following alarms has occurred, do not cycle the power repeatedly to restart. Doing so will cause a malfunction of the servo amplifier and servo motor. Remove its cause and allow about 30 minutes for cooling before resuming the operation. * [AL. 30 Regenerative error] * [AL. 45 Main circuit device overheat] * [AL. 46 Servo motor overheat] * [AL. 50 Overload 1] * [AL. 51 Overload 2] * [AL. 37 Parameter error] is not recorded in the alarm history",
